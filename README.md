## Features

### 1. Recursion

- **Explanation**: Recursion is a powerful programming technique where a function calls itself to solve complex problems. It is employed when a problem can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems. Each recursive call reduces the original problem towards a base case until it becomes trivial to solve.

### 2. Algorithm Analysis

- **Explanation**: Algorithm analysis is a fundamental aspect of computer science. It entails examining the efficiency and performance characteristics of algorithms. Understanding time and space complexity helps in selecting the most appropriate algorithm for a specific task.

### 3. Lists, Linked Lists, Double Linked Lists

- **Explanation**: Lists represent a fundamental data structure for storing collections of elements. Linked Lists and Double Linked Lists are dynamic data structures that use pointers to connect elements, enabling efficient insertions and deletions compared to static arrays.

### 4. Cursor Implementation of Linked Lists

- **Explanation**: Cursor Implementation offers an alternative approach to manage linked lists. It utilizes an array of records to represent linked list elements, providing advantages in scenarios where memory allocation for nodes is a concern.

### 5. Implementation of Stacks and Queues

- **Explanation**: Stacks and Queues are linear data structures with distinct behavior. Stacks follow the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, while Queues adhere to the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. They are widely employed in algorithmic problem solving and data processing.

### 6. Trees, Implementation of Trees, Binary Trees

- **Explanation**: Trees are hierarchical data structures with a root node and child nodes. Binary Trees are a specific type of tree in which each node can have at most two children. They play a pivotal role in various data manipulation and searching algorithms.

### 7. Expression Trees, Binary Search Trees

- **Explanation**: Expression Trees are used to represent mathematical expressions in a hierarchical format. Binary Search Trees (BSTs) are binary trees optimized for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of elements.

### 8. AVL Trees, Single and Double Rotation, Tree Traversals

- **Explanation**: AVL Trees are self-balancing binary search trees. They employ single and double rotations to maintain balance. Tree traversals are techniques to visit nodes in a specific order, including Inorder, Preorder, and Postorder traversals.

### 9. Splaying, B_Trees

- **Explanation**: Splaying is a self-adjusting binary search tree operation that brings the most recently accessed element to the root, improving future access times. B-Trees are balanced tree structures frequently utilized in databases and file systems.

### 10. Hashing

- **Explanation**: Hashing is a fundamental technique for mapping data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values (hash codes). It is commonly used for fast data retrieval by directly accessing data using its hash code as an index.

### 11. Priority Queues (Heaps)

- **Explanation**: Priority Queues are abstract data structures that efficiently provide access to the element with the highest priority. They are often implemented using Heaps, specialized tree-based structures.

### 12. Sorting, Design Techniques, Merge Sort, Analysis of Merge Sort

- **Explanation**: Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science. Merge Sort is a sorting algorithm that divides an unsorted list into smaller sublists, sorts them, and then merges them back together. Analyzing sorting algorithms helps in understanding their performance characteristics.

### 13. Quick Sort, Analysis of Quick Sort, Linear Sorting Algorithm

- **Explanation**: Quick Sort is another sorting algorithm known for its efficiency. It selects a 'pivot' element and partitions the other elements based on their relationship to the pivot. Linear Sorting Algorithms are algorithms with a time complexity linear in the number of items to be sorted.
